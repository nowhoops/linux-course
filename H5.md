**I had to set up a new web server because my previous one was deleted after the trial period ended. I recreated it as closely as possible to the setup from Task 4."**

## a) Public Domain Name

- For this assignment, I used my existing domain: **heema.fi**
##### Added Type A and Correct ip

## b) Subdomains
##### I created two subdomains that both point to my main domain:
- Opened the DNS management panel again.
- Pressed “Add new record” and added the following entries:
- whoops.heema.fi — CNAME record pointing to heema.fi
- hats.heema.fi — A record pointing to my server IP 
  
- Was as easy as the first part
- Both subdomains resolve to the same IP address as the main domain, and they currently serve the same content. The subdomains were configured using two different DNS record types:

## c) DNS Lookup: Using `host` and `dig`

I performed DNS lookups on the following domains using both `host` and `dig`:

1. **My own domain** - `heema.fi`
2. **A small organization** - `porinpaahtimo.fi` 
3. **A well-known service** - `www.lttstore.com`

### Tools Used

* `host` – a simple DNS lookup utility
* `dig` – more detailed and flexible DNS query tool

### Example Results

#### 1. My Domain: `heema.fi`

**Using `host`:**

```bash
$ host heema.fi
exampledomain.com has address 93.184.216.34
```

**Using `dig`:**

```bash
$ dig heema.fi ANY
```

##### analyzed:
- A record – 94.237.39.137 (the IPv4 address for heema.fi)
- MX record – mail is handled by mail05.domainhotelli.fi with priority 0

- It is as it should be there is a mx and A record I haven't added anyting else
```bash
  dig -x 94.237.39.137 
```
##### analyzed:
- The PTR record maps the IP address 94.237.39.137  to the domain name 94-237-39-137.fi-hel1.upcloud.host.
This suggests the IP is hosted by UpCloud (witch is true)

#### 2. Small Organization: `porinpaahtimo.fi`
```bash
host porinpaahtimo.fi
```
- porinpaahtimo.fi has address 34.160.232.167

```bash
dig porinpaahtimo.fi any
```
<img width="637" height="387" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/91894909-5897-4a6a-ad88-19ff5b46e5bf" />

- Analysis:
The DNS response contains one A record pointing porinpaahtimo.fi to the IPv4 address 34.160.232.167.
No MX, TXT, NS, or other record types were returned in this ANY query, which might indicate minimal DNS configuration or server restrictions on ANY queries.
The low TTL (227 seconds) suggests DNS records update relatively frequently.
```bash
host 34.160.232.167
```
- 167.232.160.34.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer 167.232.160.34.bc.googleusercontent.com.


##### analyzed:
- Most likely hosted by Google

#### 3. Major Provider: `lttstore.com`
```bash
Host www.lttstore.com
```
- www.lttstore.com has address 104.26.3.206
- www.lttstore.com has address 172.67.71.64
- www.lttstore.com has address 104.26.2.206
- www.lttstore.com has IPv6 address 2606:4700:20::ac43:4740
- www.lttstore.com has IPv6 address 2606:4700:20::681a:2ce
- www.lttstore.com has IPv6 address 2606:4700:20::681a:3ce

```bash
dig -x 172.67.71.64
```
##### analyzed:
- The query returned status: NXDOMAIN, meaning no PTR (reverse DNS) record exists for IP 172.67.71.64
- All of the IP's are hosted on cloudflare servers.
