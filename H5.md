I needed to start a new webserver cause my server was deleted cause my trial ended.
I made it as similar as a could with the task 4

## a) Public Domain Name

For this assignment, I used my existing domain: **heema.fi**
##### First thing to do is

## b) Subdomains

I created two subdomains that both point to my main domain:

- `linuxcourse.exampledomain.com`
- `dev.exampledomain.com`

Both subdomains resolve to the same IP address as the main domain, and they currently serve the same content. The subdomains were configured using two different DNS record types:

- **A record** for `linuxcourse.exampledomain.com`  
- **CNAME record** for `dev.exampledomain.com`

### Bonus: Name-Based Virtual Host

I also configured a separate name-based virtual host for `linuxcourse.exampledomain.com`. This allows the server to serve different content depending on which domain name was requested.

Example Apache config (or Nginx equivalent):

```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName linuxcourse.exampledomain.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/linuxcourse
</VirtualHost>
````

## c) DNS Lookup: Using `host` and `dig`

I performed DNS lookups on the following domains using both `host` and `dig`:

1. **My own domain** - `exampledomain.com`
2. **A small organization** - `somelocalclub.org` (replace with a real small org's domain)
3. **A well-known service** - `google.com`

### Tools Used

* `host` â€“ a simple DNS lookup utility
* `dig` â€“ more detailed and flexible DNS query tool

### Example Results

#### 1. My Domain: `exampledomain.com`

**Using `host`:**

```bash
$ host exampledomain.com
exampledomain.com has address 93.184.216.34
```

**Using `dig`:**

```bash
$ dig exampledomain.com ANY
```

Key fields analyzed:

* **A record** â€“ shows the IPv4 address
* **NS records** â€“ name servers responsible for this domain
* **SOA** â€“ start of authority for the DNS zone
* **TXT records** â€“ includes SPF or other metadata

Compare the `dig` output to the settings in your registrar's control panel. For instance, Namecheap displays DNS records like A, CNAME, MX, and TXT directly in the domain dashboard.

#### 2. Small Organization: `somelocalclub.org`

Using `dig` and `host`, I observed:

* A and AAAA records pointing to their server
* MX records for email handling
* Possible CNAME entries for services like `www`

#### 3. Major Provider: `google.com`

`dig google.com ANY` returned a wide range of DNS information:

* Multiple **A records** (load-balanced IPs)
* **AAAA records** for IPv6
* **SPF** and **DMARC** in **TXT records**
* **CAA records** for certificate authority authorization

## d) Bonus: SPF and DMARC Records

I analyzed the SPF and DMARC records for `google.com`.

### SPF (Sender Policy Framework)

```text
v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all
```

**Explanation:**

* `v=spf1` â€“ version of SPF
* `include:_spf.google.com` â€“ include Google's SPF definition
* `~all` â€“ soft fail for any sender not matching the rule

### DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance)

```text
v=DMARC1; p=reject; rua=mailto:dmarc-reports@google.com
```

**Explanation:**

* `v=DMARC1` â€“ version
* `p=reject` â€“ reject unauthenticated messages
* `rua` â€“ reporting address for aggregate reports

These records are important for preventing email spoofing and improving email deliverability.

> ðŸ’¡ You can use tools like [MXToolbox](https://mxtoolbox.com/) or [DMARC Analyzer](https://dmarcian.com/) to decode these records, but you should still understand and explain them manually.

## Summary

This assignment demonstrated how to configure and analyze DNS records for domains and subdomains, including the use of command-line tools such as `host` and `dig`. It also highlighted best practices in domain management and email authentication using SPF and DMARC.

I now have a better understanding of DNS fundamentals and practical tools for investigating DNS setups and security configurations.
